# very-simple-quiz

My solution for Chapter 4 Exercise 8 of “Introduction to Programming Using Java”.


Problem Description:
Write a program that administers a basic addition quiz to the user. There should be
ten questions. Each question is a simple addition problem such as 17 + 42, where the
numbers in the problem are chosen at random (and are not too big). The program should
ask the user all ten questions and get the user’s answers. After asking all the questions, the
user should print each question again, with the user’s answer. If the user got the answer
right, the program should say so; if not, the program should give the correct answer. At
the end, tell the user their score on the quiz, where each correct answer counts for ten
points.
The program should use three subroutines, one to create the quiz, one to administer
the quiz, and one to grade the quiz. It can use three arrays, with three global variables
of type int[ ], to refer to the arrays. The first array holds the first number from every
question, the second holds the second number from every questions, and the third holds
the user’s answers.

Notes: TextIO is an IO helper class created by the textbook's author to assist with IO before the book covers java's IO utilities.
